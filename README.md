# Simulation-Automated-Vehicles
we presented the updating Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) model as the scanner of heterogeneous traffic flow, which uses various sensors to detect the characteristics of traffic flow in several traffic scenes on the roads. The model contains the hardware platform, software algorithm of CAV, and the analysis of traffic flow detection and simulation by Flow Project, where the driving of vehicles is mainly controlled by Reinforcement Learning (RL). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and the corresponding swarm intelligence strategy is evaluated through simulation experiments. The results showed that the traffic flow scanning, tracking, and data recording performed continuously by CAVs are effective. The increase in the penetration rate of CAVs in the overall traffic flow has a significant effect on vehicle detection and identification. In addition, the vehicle occlusion rate is independent of the CAV lane position in all cases. The complete street scanner is a new technology that realizes the perception of the human settlement environment with the help of the Internet of Vehicles based on 5G communications and sensors. Although there are some shortcomings in the experiment, it still provides an experimental reference for the development of smart vehicles.

# How to useï¼Ÿ
1. Install anaconda2 (refer to anaconda official website https://www.anaconda.com/), then create a dedicated operating environment in the flow directory and install dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate flow
2. Install Project and SUMO:
pip install -e .
3. Check if SUMO is installed successfully:
which sumo
sumo --version
sumo-gui
4. Check if the project is installed successfully:
source activate flow
python examples/sumo/sugiyama.py

# Qusetion
There is a high probability that this step is unsuccessful, or it is unsuccessful after restarting, there will be a problem that the flow cannot be activated, or an error will be reported due to the Python version. The default python version of my system is Python2 under /usr/bin .7, but the Flow Project relies on python3.5 in the anaconda directory, and casually changing the system environment variables can easily break many framework dependencies. The solution is to run the following three sentences before running the script of Flow Project for the first time every time you boot up (the UBUNTU in the third line is changed to your home directory name):

export PATH=/usr/local/anaconda2/bin:$PATH
source activate flow
export PYTHONPATH="/home/UBUNTU/.conda/envs/flow/lib/python3.5/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"

# How to secondary development?

After this, enter python examples/sumo/sugiyama.py or other scripts under examples/sumo/ in Terminal in the flow directory to successfully run the simulation, which also means that flow is installed.

Run the model with Python, output the coordinates.
As can be seen from the official novice tutorial, the core of the simulation lies in the scripts in the examples/sumo/ directory. The author takes the modification and expansion of the one-way N-lane highway simulation creation script highway.py in this directory as an example to introduce how to Run the simulation with Python and output the coordinates of each vehicle on the road at each moment.

The road shape in the Project is limited, and the creation of new roads should be customized based on the bottom layer of SUMO, which remains to be studied in the future. Among the official road forms, the N-lane expressway is a relatively simple model. The running effect of the original script is as shown in the introduction of the simulation image above. The script has been modified:

(1) Change the source code to increase the function of changing the length of the body
Change the def add() function in class VehicleParams in params.py in the flow/core directory, and add these lines:

HighwayScenario() can be seen that this is a function specially set up for the one-way four-lane highway scene. Because the Flow Project is intended to train reinforcement learning vehicles in simple scenarios (for complex scenarios, please consider games such as GTA), there is no overly complicated vehicle network.

Among them, inflow can input the previously created InFlow() object, length refers to the length of the road (unit: m, do not be too long, otherwise the data recording after running will be interrupted), lanes is the number of lanes, which can be increased or decreased, speed_limit is the maximum speed (unit: m/s) that vehicles on each lane of the entire road will not exceed, and num_edges refers to the number of ports on the road.
